I have some things to say regarding the ongoing “hacks”.

It’s pretty obvious at this point that the users aren’t to blame. The oilman example makes it
clear a hacker was able to get extra clash hits, or simply modify their score, thus they’re not
just stealing password hashes (“api keys”) and hitting well-known apis, they’ve found holes.
But without anyone at Kong admitting this, and the vague hand-waving responses about “sharing
account info”...  it’s looking pretty clear they’re lost, and can’t fix it. It’s not a big
stretch to assume they can’t even figure out the specifics of the attack. (If they could, they
could stop it.)

Talking for months about “cloned accounts” and “reset api keys” and the like is dumb. It’s
obfuscation of the big picture. We need to stop pretending we know exactly how they’re system
works and what’s wrong.  Instead we need to insist they give a public update:

1. Admitting there is tens of millions of dollars of value in these cards 
2. Admitting someone is actively able to destroy it for significant periods of time 
3. Admitting they’re still selling this currency, and that the value of that is logically affected by #2
4. Admitting that if a user sharing a password hash was the only problem, changing the password
   hash would solve it.
5. Admitting they did #4, and it did not solve it.  (Or admit they can't change them.)

In short, explain what they know, and don’t know, and what they’re doing to protect that
currency moving forward.

I fully understand there is little we can do to pressure them on any of this.  Maybe there is
actually nothing we can do.  But if we were to get some kind of social media campaign going, I
think it would help things.  The day my cards start going missing, I'll wish I had done more.
Worse, the day Kong nopes the fuck out, and the game stops, and my $160,000 "investment"
becomes worth exactly $0...  It'll be sad.
