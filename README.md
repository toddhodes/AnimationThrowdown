Animation Throwdown scripts


These scripts 
- get your deck card inventory, and Combo Mastery, and output it as text
- allow you to automate adventure and arena fights
- allow you to automate purchasing

## Setup

### User info

To do API calls to kongregate, you need your player ID and password hash.  You can get these
by turning on the "Developer Console" in your web browser, and investigating some of the traffic
while playing the game. This is the *same info* you use to register with Zbot; the user ID is your
player ID, visible in your player detail card.  Asking about this in the Line messaging 
app in your guild's channel (see `https://line.me/`) as if you're using ZBot is the easiest way to get help on this.

Once you have these, add them to a file called `.at_creds` in your home directory (`~/.at_creds`),
formatted as follows:

```
user_id=8679305
password_hash=6BhhkA23C47ED572
```

replacing those values with those matching your account.

I'll add more details on this later.


### Mac software dependencies

You'll need a few programs you may not have installed yet.  Run this:

```
brew install curl XMLStarlet jq
```



## Generate card inventory and combo mastery

### Run this in your Terminal app:

In the directory where you cloned this, simply run
```
make
```

and that's it!  It does the rest for you.  If this doesn't work for you, email me, happy to help.

### Sample output

Here's some sample output, edited to be shorter; you can see my complete card
set as generated by these scripts here:

and simiarly the combo masteries as generated by the scripts here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toddhodes/AnimationThrowdown/master/Combos/ComboMastery

Here are excerpts, highlighting how the epic/legendary/mythic and fused level display, and, 
how CM level and CM stones are shown combined together:

*Decks/CARDS:*

First column is number of cards with that exact level fusing.  Second column is Rare/Epic/Legendary/Mythic.  Third Column is card name.  Fourth column is the level of fusing.  e.g., this shows 10 max-fused legendary Zapp character cards and a Mythic Zapp.

```
  10 L Zapp Brannigan: 6**
   1 M Zapp Brannigan: 2**
```


*Combos/ComboMastery:*

First column is Combo Mastery level, 0-3. Second column is the combo name.  Third column is the number of item mastery stones available for that particular combo, blank for none. It takes 5 for CM1, 25 more for CM2, and 100 more for CM3.  Thus an available but unresearched CM3 would list 0 | Sample | 130.  
The `Mastery Stone` line lists your Mastery Stones, the currency used to purchase stones from the Shop's Mastery tab.

```
3 | Beer Snot
2 | Alley Entertainment | 100
2 | Beer Jeff
1 | Artsy Tina | 5
1 | Butcher Knife Jeff
0 | Hot Cocoa Louise | 130
245950 | Mastery Stone
```
